# OS-Concurrency-Leetcode-
The question is based upon concurrency and I'm using semaphores for solving this question.
# Why Use Semaphores in Concurrency?
Semaphores are a fundamental synchronization primitive in concurrent programming.Proper use of semaphores can help avoid deadlocks by allowing threads to wait for resources in a controlled manner.They facilitate communication between threads, allowing one thread to signal another when it has completed a task.
